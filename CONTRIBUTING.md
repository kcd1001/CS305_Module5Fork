# Report Bugs
This section guides you through submitting a bug report for module5. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report üìù, reproduce the behavior üíª üíª, and find related reports üîé.

Check the debugging guide. You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself. Most importantly, check if you can reproduce the problem in the latest version of Atom, if the problem happens when you run Atom in safe mode, and if you can get the desired behavior by changing Atom's or packages' config settings.
Check the faq and the discussions for a list of common questions and problems.
Determine which repository the problem should be reported in.
Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
